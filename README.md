# Landing Page Project 1

The aim of this project is to enable me to apply and reinforce the foundational **HTML** and **CSS** skills I've acquired to build a complete webpage.

The goal is to create a landing page with four main sections and a footer, closely matching the provided design while encouraging independent problem-solving and research. The project emphasizes practical application of web development fundamentals without requiring perfect precision.


## Skills Used
To successfully complete this project, I will be utilizing the following skills to achieve the desired layout:
- **HTML:** Structuring the webpage content, including text, images, links and layout elements for the four main sections and footer.
- **CSS:** Styling the webpage to match the design images, including fonts, colors, and layout techniques like Flexbox for positioning and alignment.
- **Git:** Managing version control by committing changes early and often, following best practices for commit messages.
- **Research Skills:** Using external resources (eg.,Google searches for CSS properties like rounded corners) to address unfamiliar details.
- **Problem-Solving:** Breaking the project into manageable sections, starting with **HTML** structure before applying CSS styles and further refining the design.
